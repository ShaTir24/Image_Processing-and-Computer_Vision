# Image Processing and Computer Vision Practicals

## The Repository contains source code and resultant images for following:
1. Converting an Image to:-
    - Resize
    - Grayscale
    - Binary (B&W)
    - Complement
2. Performing following operations:-
    - Histogram Stretching
    - Histogram Equalization
3. Applying following filters to an image:-
    - Mean Filter (Linear)
    - Median Filter
    - Gaussian Blur
    - Laplace Filter (Non-Linear)
4. Applying following transformations to an image:-
    - Discrete Fourier Transformation
    - Inverse Fourier Transformation
5. Implementing following feature extraction techniques:-
    - SIFT Feature Extraction
    - HOG Feature Extraction
6. Implementing following segmentation techniques:-
    - Edge-Based (Sobel) Segmentation
    - Frequency-Based (Otsu's Threshold) Segmentation
    - Region-Based (grow) Segmentation
7. Implement Sparse Object Flow (Lucas-Kanade Method)
8. (Similar to 7)
9. Implement object Detection and Recognition using Yolo** and opencv
10. Implement Facial Recognition program in python with necessary steps

## Find the Lab Manual for detailed information
** For Yolo, find the dependency files in Yolo folder. It does not include yolov3.weights file whcih you can download from: https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
